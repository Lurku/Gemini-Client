        "ai": "Yes, the Earth is round! It's actually an oblate spheroid, which means it's slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. \n\nThere's a lot of evidence to support this, like:\n\n* **Ships disappearing hull first over the horizon:** If the Earth was flat, we'd see ships gradually fade into the distance, but they actually disappear hull first.\n* **Different constellations seen in different hemispheres:** If the Earth was flat, we'd see the same constellations from everywhere, but people in different hemispheres see different sets of stars.\n* **Photos of Earth from space:**  We've taken countless photos of Earth from space, and they clearly show a round planet. \n\nDo you have any other questions about the shape of the Earth? \n"

        "ai": "Marriage is a legally and socially recognized union between two people, typically a man and a woman, that creates kinship between them. It is often accompanied by a formal ceremony and involves a commitment to share life together, including responsibilities and rights. \n\nHere are some key aspects of marriage:\n\n* **Legally Binding:**  Marriage is a legal contract that creates rights and obligations for both partners. This can include things like inheritance, property rights, and healthcare decisions.\n* **Social Contract:**  Marriage is also a social institution, with customs and traditions that vary widely across cultures and religions. \n* **Commitment and Responsibility:**  Marriage is based on a commitment to share life together, including responsibilities like financial support, household chores, and raising children. \n* **Love and Companionship:**  While not always the case, marriage is often motivated by love and the desire for companionship.\n\nThe concept of marriage has evolved over time, with changes in legal definitions, social acceptance, and cultural norms. For example, same-sex marriage is now legal in many countries, and there are different types of marriage ceremonies and arrangements across the world. \n\nWhat specific aspects of marriage are you interested in? Do you have any other questions about it? \n"
